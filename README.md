## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Laravel!

ðŸ‘¯ I'm looking to collaborate on mind-blowing web development projects, or at least, life-easing ones.

ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with figuring out why CSS insists on being so stubborn. Alignment struggles are real!

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about  my journey from engineering to web developmentâ€”Iâ€™ve got stories, lessons, and maybe a few laughs to share!

âš¡ Fun fact: I'm the only industrial engineer in my class who traded production lines for misbehaving divs. Thrilling, right?
