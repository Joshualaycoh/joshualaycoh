I Am Joshua. I've Made A Shift From Optimizing Physical Processes To Crafting Digital Ones.
   - Portfolio: https://mycodejourney.vercel.app/

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning generative AI! Here is my first AI project(https://joshualaycoh.github.io/Generative-AI-Clone/)

âš¡ Fun fact: I'm the only industrial engineer in my class who traded production lines for misbehaving divs. Thrilling, right?

ðŸ‘¯ I'm looking to collaborate on mind-blowing web development projects, or at least, life-easing ones.
