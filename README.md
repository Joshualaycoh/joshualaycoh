## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

From optimizing production lines to crafting web experiences. Joshua Homo | Industrial Engineer turned Web Dev.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning generative AI! Here is my first AI work(https://joshualaycoh.github.io/Generative-AI-Clone/)

âš¡ Fun fact: I'm the only industrial engineer in my class who traded production lines for misbehaving divs. Thrilling, righ

ðŸ‘¯ I'm looking to collaborate on mind-blowing web development projects, or at least, life-easing ones.
