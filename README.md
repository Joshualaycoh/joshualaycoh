## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ... Laravel!

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on ... web development projects that will blow people's mindsâ€”or, at the very least, make their lives a bit easier.

ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with ... figuring out why CSS insists on being so stubborn. Alignment struggles are real!

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about ... my journey from engineering to web developmentâ€”Iâ€™ve got stories, lessons, and maybe a few laughs to share!

ðŸ“« How to reach me: ... j.laycohomo@gmail.com

âš¡ Fun fact: ... I'm the only engineer-turned-web-developer in my class. Because apparently, optimizing production lines isn't nearly as thrilling as 
figuring out why your div is misbehaving. Go figure.
