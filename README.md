## Hi there 👋
🌱 I’m currently learning generative AI!

👯 I'm looking to collaborate on mind-blowing web development projects, or at least, life-easing ones.

🤔 I’m looking for help with figuring out why CSS insists on being so stubborn. Alignment struggles are real!

💬 Ask me about  my journey from engineering to web development—I’ve got stories, lessons, and maybe a few laughs to share!

⚡ Fun fact: I'm the only industrial engineer in my class who traded production lines for misbehaving divs. Thrilling, right?
